# Capability View

The capability view describes the organizational membersâ€™ characteristics relevant to performing their duties. Natural persons can be described by their physical and mental characteristics, like height, weight and temperament. These characteristics manifest themselves in the form of skills. In the organizational context, we are only interested in the subset of skills needed to carry out business tasks. The Figure bellow presents the relationship between the required skills and the inherent skills of a natural person.
