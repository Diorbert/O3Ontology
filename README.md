# The O3 Ontology

The industry’s need for enterprise architecture description has been supported by many approaches that include ontologies and languages. Despite the alternative solutions, some approaches have specific purpose and shortcomings with consequences in precision and coverage. The OntoUML Organizational Ontology (O3) is a well-founded core ontology, built with the purpose of serving as a reference ontology for organizational definition. It is intended to support the creation of domain ontologies through the specialization of its concepts and relationships, as well as to support the analysis and revision of EA languages.
